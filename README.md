# Data Science Projects
Welcome to the "Data Science Projects" repository! This repository contains various data science projects that showcase different techniques and approaches for working with data.

## Projects
### Object Detection
This project uses computer vision techniques to detect objects in images and videos. It demonstrates how to use popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras to train and deploy object detection models.

### Sales Analysis
This project analyzes and visualizes sales data to identify trends and patterns that can inform decision-making. It uses Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

### Sentiment Analysis
This project uses natural language processing techniques to classify the sentiment of text data. It demonstrates how to preprocess text data, build and train a machine learning model using scikit-learn, and deploy the model in a web application using Flask.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It demonstrates how to preprocess credit card transaction data, build and train a machine learning model using scikit-learn, and evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

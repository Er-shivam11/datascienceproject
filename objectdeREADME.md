# YOLO Object Detection using Ultralytics
## Introduction
This project uses Ultralytics YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to perform object detection on images. The YOLO algorithm is a popular deep learning model used for real-time object detection. It is known for its speed and accuracy in detecting multiple objects in a single image.

## Library
This project uses the Ultralytics YOLO library, which is built on top of PyTorch. It provides pre-trained models and utilities for training and evaluating custom object detection models.

## Dataset
This project uses the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which contains over 330,000 images with over 2.5 million object instances. The dataset contains 80 object categories, including people, animals, vehicles, and more.

## Usage
To use this project, first, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. 
Then, use the pre-trained YOLO model to detect objects in your images. You can also fine-tune the model on your own custom dataset using the provided utilities.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use the Ultralytics YOLO library to perform object detection on images. With its fast and accurate detection capabilities,
YOLO is an excellent choice for real-time object detection applications.
